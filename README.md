## Instructions
Each ostrich can move left, right, and up. Due to gravity, the ostrich will have a downward force and 
will move down if not moving up by input. The max velocity of the ostrich up and down is 275 pixels 
per second. The wing flap lasts 0.1 seconds allowing the player to quickly change a downwards velocity 
to an upwards velocity. A single wing flap will increase the ostrich's upward acceleration by 1375 pixels 
per second squared for the duration of the wing flap.

Left - Pressing the A or left arrow key
Right - Pressing the D or right arrow key
Up - Pressing the W or up arrow key
Down - Gravity
