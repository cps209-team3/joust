## Instructions
Each ostrich can move left, right, and up. Due to gravity, the ostrich will have a downward force and 
will move down if not moving up by input. The wing flap lasts 0.1 seconds allowing the player to quickly change a downwards velocity 
to an upwards velocity. A single wing flap will increase the ostrich's upward speed for the duration of the wing flap.

* Left - Pressing the A or left arrow key
* Right - Pressing the D or right arrow key
* Up - Pressing the W or up arrow key
